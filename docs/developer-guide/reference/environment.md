# Environment Variables Reference

Complete reference of all environment variables, their types, defaults, and validation rules.

## Overview

All environment variables are validated on startup using Zod. Invalid values cause the server to fail with a descriptive error message. None of the variables are strictly required - all have sensible defaults for local development. For Docker deployments, `DATA_DIR` and `UPLOADS_DIR` are set automatically in the image.

::: warning v2.0.0 Breaking Change
All file-related variables have been renamed with a `FILE_` prefix (e.g. `MAX_FILE_SIZE` -> `FILE_MAX_SIZE`). Old names are no longer supported. See the migration table below.
