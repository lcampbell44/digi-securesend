All notable changes to SkySend are documented here.

## v2.12.0 - New Website, Branding & UX Improvements, Security Hardening, and Security Patches
*Released: July 30, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **website**: Added a new public website (homepage, roadmap, blog, and a Server Instances section listing live public instances), plus a Report Abuse page for flagging file and note links.
- **infra**: Moved the abuse report Cloudflare Worker into the monorepo (`workers/report`), alongside the existing instances worker.
- **web**: The download page now shows the file name, file list, and size as soon as the link is opened, instead of only after starting the download. ([#66](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/66))
- **web**: Uploads in "My Uploads" can be given an optional name, and multi-file uploads now list their file names instead of only a count. ([#67](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/67))
- **server**: Branding assets placed in the data directory are now served by the instance itself, so a custom logo no longer needs an external URL. ([#66](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/66))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: A repeated wrong password on the download page shows the error message again instead of staying silent after the first attempt.
- **web**: A custom logo that cannot be loaded now falls back to the built-in logo instead of leaving a broken image in the header.
- **web**: The file list on the download page now scrolls through all files instead of cutting off after the first few, and long file names no longer hide the file size.
- **client**: Notes with an unlimited view limit now show "3 / ∞" in the TUI note detail instead of "3 / 0 (-3 remaining)". Thanks @Osamaali313 ([#65](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/pull/65))
- **web**: Share links whose fragment was percent-encoded by a mail security filter now open correctly instead of showing "not found", and warn that the key was exposed. ([#68](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/68))

### 🔒 Security

- **server**: `CUSTOM_LOGO` no longer accepts protocol-relative URLs such as `//example.com/logo.png`, which loaded an external image outside the Content Security Policy origin check.
- **server**: Updated `@hono/node-server` to 2.0.12 to patch an unauthenticated memory-leak denial of service triggered by aborted WebSocket handshakes (GHSA-9mqv-5hh9-4cgg).
- **server**: Updated hono to 4.12.32 to patch cross-request data disclosure in JSX server-side rendering, XSS via the `cx()` utility, and header de-duplication in the AWS Lambda adapter (GHSA-hvrm-45r6-mjfj, GHSA-w62v-xxxg-mg59, GHSA-xgm2-5f3f-mvvc).
- **web**: Updated react-router to 8 to patch a CSRF bypass that allowed actions to run before a 400 response (GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2).
- **web**: Updated dompurify to 3.4.12 to fix a sanitizer bypass for allowed custom elements (GHSA-c2j3-45gr-mqc4).
- **infra**: Added pnpm overrides for `sharp` and `brace-expansion`, raised the `postcss` override, and removed the unused `autoprefixer` dependency to clear transitive advisories (GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj, GHSA-3jxr-9vmj-r5cp, GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg, GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849).
- **server**: The request log no longer records anything after the ID in a file, note, or download path, so a link rewritten by a mail security filter cannot leave its key in the log. ([#68](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/68))

### 🎨 Improvements

- **server**: Startup now points out when `CUSTOM_LOGO` refers to an external host, and how to serve the file from the instance instead.
- **web**: The selected-files list on the upload page uses the app's own slim scrollbar instead of the browser's native one, and hovering a shortened file name shows it in full.

### 🔄 Changed

- **web**: On password-protected download links, entering the password now unlocks the file details, and the download starts with a separate click. ([#66](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/66))
- **web**: The placeholder for uploads without metadata now reads "Protected file" instead of "Encrypted file". ([#66](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/66))

### 📝 Documentation

- **docs**: Documented the branding directory and switched the custom logo examples from an external URL to a local path.
- **docs**: Documented how mail security filters rewrite share links, what that means for the encryption key, and what a reverse proxy logs. ([#68](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/68))

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **infra**: Added a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the report worker on push, matching the existing instances worker deploy pipeline.
- **infra**: `pnpm update:check` now lists outdated dependencies per workspace package with a summary, instead of one merged table that ends in `Command failed with exit code 1`.

## v2.11.3 - Dependency Updates and Bug Fixes
*Released: June 21, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **server**: Fixed intermittent 500/502 errors for static assets behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Traefik) after a deployment by keeping server connections alive longer than the proxy's idle timeout, so the proxy no longer reuses a closed connection.

### 🔒 Security

- **server**: Updated hono to 4.12.26 to patch CORS credential reflection, IP restriction bypass, cookie injection, JWT scheme bypass, path traversal in `serve-static`, and AWS Lambda body-limit bypass (GHSA-88fw-hqm2-52qc, GHSA-xrhx-7g5j-rcj5, GHSA-3hrh-pfw6-9m5x, GHSA-f577-qrjj-4474, GHSA-2gcr-mfcq-wcc3, GHSA-wwfh-h76j-fc44, GHSA-rv63-4mwf-qqc2, GHSA-j6c9-x7qj-28xf, GHSA-wgpf-jwqj-8h8p).
- **web**: Updated vite to 8.0.16 to fix `server.fs.deny` bypass and NTLMv2 hash disclosure on Windows (GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff).
- **web**: Updated dompurify to 3.4.11 to fix multiple XSS and attribute-pollution vulnerabilities (GHSA-hpcv-96wg-7vj8, GHSA-r47g-fvhr-h676, GHSA-rp9w-3fw7-7cwq, GHSA-76mc-f452-cxcm, GHSA-gvmj-g25r-r7wr, GHSA-vxr8-fq34-vvx9, GHSA-cmwh-pvxp-8882).
- **infra**: Added pnpm overrides for `ws` (`>=8.21.0`), `miniflare>undici` (`>=7.28.0`), `tsx>esbuild` and `wrangler>esbuild` (`>=0.28.1`), `@babel/core` (`>=7.29.6`), and updated the `vitepress>vite` override to `>=6.4.3 <7` to address transitive advisories in dev dependencies (GHSA-96hv-2xvq-fx4p, GHSA-58qx-3vcg-4xpx, GHSA-vmh5-mc38-953g, GHSA-hm92-r4w5-c3mj, GHSA-vxpw-j846-p89q, GHSA-pr7r-676h-xcf6, GHSA-p88m-4jfj-68fv, GHSA-35p6-xmwp-9g52, GHSA-g8m3-5g58-fq7m, GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr, GHSA-4x5r-pxfx-6jf8, GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff).
- **server**: Updated `@hono/node-server` to 2.0.5 to patch a serve-static middleware path-prefix bypass on Windows.

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **infra**: Bumped patch-level dependencies across the monorepo (radix-ui components, react, react-i18next, idb-keyval, tailwindcss, vue, vitest, tsx, prettier, and related type definitions). Updated i18next to 26.3.1 to satisfy the updated react-i18next peer requirement.
- **infra**: Bumped minor-level dependencies across the monorepo (AWS SDK v3, react-router-dom, radix-ui react-select/slot/switch, lucide-react, better-sqlite3, ink, eslint, typescript-eslint, wrangler, @cloudflare/workers-types).
- **infra**: Updated commander to v15, @types/node to v26, @tailwindcss/typography to 0.5.20, and fflate to 0.8.3.

## v2.11.2 - Cache-Control Fiexes & View Count Bug Fix
*Released: June 5, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **server**: The view count returned after opening a note now reflects the authoritative stored value, and notes that have reached their view limit are handled correctly. ([#59](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/59))

### 🎨 Improvements

- **server**: Added Cache-Control headers so proxies no longer cache transient server errors, while content-hashed assets are served with long-term immutable caching.

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **infra**: Added `typecheck` scripts to every TypeScript package so `pnpm validate` and CI now type-check the entire monorepo, not just the web app, preventing type errors from slipping through to the Docker build.
- **infra**: The `typecheck` task now builds its workspace library dependencies first, so type checking resolves cross-package types from source and passes in a clean checkout instead of relying on previously built output.

## v2.11.1 - Adaptive ZIP Compression & Packing Events in Debug Info Panel
*Released: May 31, 2026*

### 🎨 Improvements

- **web**: ZIP packing now uses store-only compression (`level: 0`) for already-compressed formats (audio, video, images, archives, and office documents), reducing CPU load on mobile devices without affecting ZIP output size.
- **client**: Same adaptive compression as the web app - the CLI and TUI now also apply store-only mode for pre-compressed formats when packing multiple files.
- **web**: The Technical Info timeline now shows packing events for multi-file uploads - "Packing started" when the ZIP phase begins and "Packing complete · Ø X MB/s" with the average throughput when it finishes.

### 🧪 Tests

- **server**: Brought `routes/note.ts` to 100% coverage.
- **web**: Brought `useUpload` and `useUploadHistory` to 100% coverage.
- **client**: Brought `lib/config.ts` to 100% coverage.

## v2.11.0 - Password Protection Algorithm Removal, New Copy Button for Password Values, and Improvements
*Released: May 30, 2026*

> ⚠️ **Breaking:** Password-protected uploads created with **PBKDF2** (prior to v2.4.0) or the **legacy Argon2id** parameters (v2.4.0 - v2.5.0, 4-day window) can no longer be decrypted - both algorithms have been fully removed from the decryption pipeline. All such uploads have exceeded their maximum retention period and have expired, but any password-protected file from those eras cannot be opened after upgrading to this version.

### ✨ Features

- **web**: Added a copy button to the password value fields in the "password" tab, matching the behaviour of the "password protection" input.

### 🎨 Improvements

- **web**: Fixed the password generator not closing after clicking "generate" in the "password" tab.

### 🗑️ Removed

- **crypto**: Removed PBKDF2-SHA256 decryption support - `deriveKeyFromPasswordPbkdf2` and `PBKDF2_ITERATIONS` are deleted, `deriveKeyFromPassword` now requires an Argon2id function and no longer accepts `undefined` as a fallback. All pre-v2.5.0 PBKDF2-protected uploads have expired.
- **web**: Removed `"pbkdf2"` from the `passwordAlgo` Zod enum in the download and note-info API schemas - responses containing this value are now treated as invalid.
- **client**: Removed `"pbkdf2"` from the `passwordAlgo` Zod enum in the file-info and note-info API schemas, and removed the PBKDF2 decryption branch from `prepareDownload`.
- **server**: Removed `"pbkdf2"` from the accepted `passwordAlgo` upload header values - any upload attempt with this algorithm now returns HTTP 400.
- **crypto**: Removed `ARGON2_PARAMS_LEGACY` (19 MiB / 2 iterations) and the `argon2Params` optional parameter from `deriveKeyFromPassword` - the return type is now the literal `"argon2id-v2"`. All uploads created during the 4-day `"argon2id"` window (v2.4.0 - v2.5.0) have expired.
- **web**: Removed `"argon2id"` from the `passwordAlgo` Zod enum in the download and note-info API schemas - responses with the legacy algorithm are now treated as invalid.
- **client**: Removed `"argon2id"` from the `passwordAlgo` Zod enum and the legacy decryption branch in `prepareDownload` - the function now always uses the current Argon2id parameters.
- **server**: Removed `"argon2id"` from the accepted `passwordAlgo` upload header values - new uploads with this algorithm now return HTTP 400.

## v2.10.1 - S3 Download CORS Error Handling and Debug Info Panel Storage Backend Events
*Released: May 28, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **web**: Added an `isS3CorsError()` pattern to `showKnownErrorToast()` so S3/R2 CORS failures during download are shown as an enriched toast with a Copy button and a link to the troubleshooting docs.
- **web**: The Debug Info Panel event timeline now shows which storage backend is active: "S3 upload active" when the server uses S3/R2 for an upload, and "S3 presigned URL received" when a download fetches directly from S3/R2 (all three download tiers covered).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Fixed S3 downloads via presigned URL crashing the download page. After the switch from iframe to `<a>` navigation for Service Worker streaming, a CORS or network error from the S3/R2 bucket caused the browser to navigate the main page away. The Service Worker now catches those errors, signals the main thread via BroadcastChannel to fall back to the next download tier, and returns a safe attachment response to prevent page navigation.

## v2.10.0 - New Copy & Share Features, Download UX Improvements, and Bug Fixes
*Released: May 24, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **web**: Added a copy button and a password generator button to the "Password protection" input on all upload types.
- **web**: Added a "View" button (eye icon) to note cards in "My Uploads" to open the share link directly in the browser.
- **web**: The browser favicon now shows a circular progress indicator during active downloads and is restored once the download finishes, fails, or is cancelled.
- **web**: Added a "Cancel Download" button that aborts the active download across all tiers (Service Worker, File System Access, Blob).
- **web**: Added an in-app Debug Info Panel with runtime details (download tier, browser, DevTools status, file size, transport, event timeline) and a "Copy to clipboard" button.
- **web**: Added a Firefox DevTools detection warning modal when DevTools are docked at download start, with a retry button and an escape-hatch to proceed anyway.
- **web**: Average download speed is now shown in the download completion card (e.g. "Ø 85.3 MB/s"), matching the existing upload display.
- **client**: Average download speed is now shown in the CLI output and TUI completion screen after a successful download.
- **web**: Replaced inline error messages with a global toast notification system for upload, note, SSH key, and decryption errors.
- **web**: Added a `showToast()` helper with optional Copy and Docs action buttons for enriched toast notifications.
- **web**: Added `showKnownErrorToast()` that automatically enriches crypto pipeline errors (e.g. missing HTTPS) with a title, Copy button, and Docs link.
- **web**: Added an `isOriginNotAllowedError()` pattern to `showKnownErrorToast()` for misconfigured `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` WebSocket rejections.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Fixed the note password input becoming permanently disabled after a wrong password attempt.
- **web**: Fixed the SSH key fingerprint overflowing its container on narrow screens.
- **web**: Fixed the remove button and file-size badge being pushed off-screen for files with very long names in the upload list.
- **web**: Removed per-record `console.debug` calls from the Service Worker download pipeline that caused multi-minute Firefox UI freezes on large files.

### 🎨 Improvements

- **web**: Replaced the `clients.matchAll()` broadcast in the Service Worker with a `BroadcastChannel("skysend-download")` for all SW-to-main-thread and config messages.
- **web**: Increased the Service Worker ReadableStream `highWaterMark` from `2` to `8` to prevent brief download UI freezes on slow or jittery connections.
- **web**: Added lightweight diagnostic logging to the Service Worker (stream-start summary, per-1000-record checkpoints, slow-read alerts, double-`readMore()` detection).

### 🧪 Tests

- **web**: Brought `apps/web` test coverage to 100% - added tests for `isFirefox`, `isDevToolsOpen`, and `getBrowserInfo` in utils, dismiss-all and multi-toast UPDATE in `useToast`, `loadInfo` non-`ApiError` path and `view()` without prior `loadInfo` in `useNoteView`, transport worker messages in `useUpload`, and 410/multi-upload branch coverage in `useUploadHistory`. Added `/* v8 ignore next */` annotations on dead-code and unreachable branches in `useUpload`, `useToast`, and `useNoteView`.
- **client**: Brought `apps/client` test coverage to 100% - added token storage tests (array JSON, corrupt JSON, `clearStoredToken`) to `config`, rejection-sampling branch test to `password-generator`. Added `/* v8 ignore next */` annotations on dead-code branches in `progress` and `oidc`.

## v2.9.5 - Cache-Control Fixes for Stale Content and Traefik Caching
*Released: May 20, 2026*

### 🎨 Improvements

- **server**: Changed `Cache-Control` for `index.html` and `download-sw.js` from `no-cache, must-revalidate` to `no-store`. `no-cache` permits storing the response and requires proxy revalidation via ETag or Last-Modified headers, which SkySend does not set - causing Traefik's caching middleware to fall back to its own TTL and serve stale HTML after a deployment. `no-store` is unconditional and prevents any proxy from storing the response, eliminating the need for a Traefik restart after updates.
- **server**: Added a global `Cache-Control: no-store` middleware to all `/api/*` routes. Previously only the successful download stream response carried this header. Error responses from any API endpoint (e.g. a transient 500 from the download route) had no cache directive, allowing Traefik to cache them. A single cached error response caused all subsequent requests to the same URL to receive the cached error until the proxy was restarted.

## v2.9.4 - Service Worker Download Fixes for Firefox & Improved Caching
*Released: May 20, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Added `try/catch` around both `crypto.subtle.decrypt` calls in the Service Worker. An unauthenticated or corrupted encrypted record caused the decrypt call to throw, which rejected the `pull()` promise and let Firefox mark the download as completed with the incorrect partial file size. The stream is now explicitly errored via `controller.error()` and a `dl-error` broadcast is sent to the UI on failure.
- **web**: Added a `cancelled` flag to the Service Worker's `cancel()` handler, checked at every `await` boundary in `pull()`. Previously, calling `cancel()` while `pull()` was awaiting `readMore()` let `pull()` continue executing on an already-cancelled stream, which could reach `controller.close()` and throw.

### 🎨 Improvements

- **web**: Changed the Service Worker ReadableStream from `highWaterMark: 0` to `highWaterMark: 2` to address reported Firefox browser freezes during large-file downloads. With `highWaterMark: 0`, `pull()` is only triggered by a pending consumer `read()`, which may cause Firefox's download pipeline to block until a decrypted record is ready. With `highWaterMark: 2`, `pull()` runs proactively and keeps up to two pre-decrypted records in the internal queue, reducing the chance of a synchronous stall. `pull()` still enqueues exactly one record per call, so the stall-at-random-percentage behavior from v2.9.2 cannot recur.
- **server**: `download-sw.js` is now served with `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`. Previously the file was served by the static file middleware with no explicit cache header, allowing browsers and intermediate proxies to apply heuristic caching. With `no-cache`, browsers byte-check the Service Worker file on every navigation and register any updated version immediately after a deployment, so users are never stuck running an outdated SW.
- **web**: Replaced the single-buffer copy strategy in the Service Worker ECE decryption pipeline with a zero-copy chunk queue. Previously `appendToBuf()` copied both the leftover bytes from the previous chunk (~65 KB) and the newly received chunk (~65 KB) into a fresh combined buffer on every `pull()` call - generating ~5 GB of unnecessary allocations for a 2.4 GB file. The new implementation pushes incoming `reader.read()` chunks into a queue by reference. `readFromBuf()` copies only the bytes required for the current decrypt call (one record, 65552 bytes), reducing GC pressure by roughly 2.5x and eliminating the speed oscillation and browser sluggishness during large downloads.
- **web**: Eliminated the per-record `Uint8Array` allocation in `readFromBuf()` by introducing a pre-allocated `scratchRecord` buffer (`ENCRYPTED_RECORD_SIZE` bytes) that is reused across all `pull()` calls. `crypto.subtle.decrypt` copies its input synchronously before returning the Promise, making the buffer safe to reuse as soon as the `await` resolves. This removes a further ~2.4 GB of GC-managed allocations per large file download, reducing peak heap pressure and Firefox RAM consumption.

## v2.9.3 - Debugging Service Worker Download Stalling in Firefox
*Released: May 17, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Fixed Service Worker downloads stalling at a random percentage (e.g. 0%, 13%, 21%) on Firefox with fast network connections. The `pull()` handler was processing all buffered ECE records in a single call, enqueuing multiple chunks at once. Firefox v128+ enforces the `highWaterMark: 0` pull-based contract more strictly and loses its backpressure state when `pull()` enqueues more than one chunk, causing the ReadableStream to stop requesting more data mid-download. The inner loop is now replaced with a single-record-per-`pull()` pattern followed by an early `return`, which gives Firefox's download manager time to consume each chunk before the next one is produced.

### 🧪 Tests

- **web**: Added `console.debug` diagnostic logging to the Service Worker's `pull()` and `readMore()` functions.

## v2.9.2 - Firefox Hotfix release & Browser Cache fix
*Released: May 17, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Fixed Firefox hanging on Service Worker-streamed downloads for files >= 2 GiB. Firefox has a long-standing signed 32-bit integer overflow in its internal download pipeline that triggers when `Content-Length` is >= 2^31 bytes, causing the download manager to stall or cancel at the end. The `Content-Length` header is now omitted for files >= 2 GiB so Firefox falls back to reading until EOF. Files below 2 GiB and all other browsers are unaffected. Thanks @Dominion0815
- **web**: Fixed the Service Worker download progress not reaching 100% and the UI not transitioning to "done" after the download completes. The `dl-done` broadcast was fire-and-forget - Firefox terminates the SW as soon as `waitUntil` resolves, abandoning the still-pending `clients.matchAll()` call before the message is delivered. All completion broadcasts are now awaited before `streamDone()` is called.

### 🎨 Improvements

- **server**: The SPA entry point (`index.html`) is now served with `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`. This prevents browsers and reverse proxies (e.g. Traefik with a caching middleware) from serving a stale `index.html` after a deployment. Without this, a cached old `index.html` referencing a previous JS bundle hash would cause 500 errors for the JS assets because the old filenames no longer exist on the new server.

## v2.9.1 - Fixes for Large File Downloads in Firefox and SEO Meta Tag Improvements
*Released: May 16, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Fixed large file downloads in Firefox being truncated at ~40-50% when using Service Worker streaming. The hidden `<iframe>` navigation trigger has been replaced with an `<a>` click (no `download` attribute), matching Mozilla Send's approach. Firefox was cutting the SW stream during the iframe-to-download-manager handoff, resulting in incomplete files.

### 🎨 Improvements

- **web**: Updated SEO meta tags (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter Card) to mention both file and note sharing. Added `og:image` and `twitter:image` for rich link previews on Discord and other platforms. The image defaults to `/logo.png` and can be overridden with the `VITE_OG_IMAGE` environment variable at build time.
- **web**: The page `<title>` and OG/Twitter title tags now reflect `CUSTOM_TITLE` at runtime. When `CUSTOM_TITLE=MyShare` is set, the preview title becomes "MyShare | Encrypted File & Note Transfer" instead of "SkySend | ...".
- **server**: The SPA fallback route now injects `CUSTOM_TITLE` into the served `index.html` at request time (cached after first read) so link-preview scrapers see the correct title without a separate build-time variable.

### 🔄 Changed

- **docs**: The Domain has moved from `skysend.ch` to `skysend.app`. All documentation, API references, and examples have been updated to reflect the new domain. The old `skysend.ch` URLs will continue to work and redirect to `skysend.app` for the foreseeable future.
- **server**: Added `CUSTOM_REPORT_URL` environment variable. When set, a "Report" link appears in the footer pointing to the configured URL - intended for abuse/report pages. Instance operators who do not set this variable will not show the link.

## v2.9.0 - Multi-block Code Notes and UI Improvements
*Released: May 15, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **web**: Added multi-block code notes. The Code tab now supports multiple code blocks per note, each with an optional filename/title and a language selector (Auto-detect or one of 44 supported languages). On the view page, blocks show a detected language badge and can be collapsed individually or all at once - single-block notes expand by default, multi-block notes start collapsed. ([#45](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/45))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Fixed the password generator length input being slightly clipped for three-digit values (100+). The field width was increased from `w-16` to `w-20` so numbers like 106 or 128 are fully visible.
- **web**: Fixed invisible burn-after-reading warning text in light mode. The warning box now uses `text-destructive` (colored) instead of `text-destructive-foreground` (white), making the text readable on the light semi-transparent red background. ([#46](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/46))
- **web**: Fixed syntax highlighting in code snippets for light mode. The code block now uses the GitHub light theme in light mode (`#f6f8fa` background) and the Arta dark theme in dark mode (`#222` background), ensuring all tokens are readable in both themes. ([#45](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/45))

## v2.8.0 - OIDC/SSO Authentication, General Improvements, Security & Dependency Patches
*Released: May 14, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **server**: Added optional OIDC/SSO authentication via a plugin adapter system. Supports Generic, PocketID, Authentik, and Keycloak providers via the `OIDC_PROVIDER` env var. File uploads and note creation can each be independently protected using `OIDC_PROTECT_FILES` and `OIDC_PROTECT_NOTES`. Both HTTP and WebSocket upload transports are guarded. Sessions are stateless JWT cookies - no database changes required.
- **web**: Added inline auth blocks on the upload page when OIDC is enabled and the user is not logged in. A user indicator with logout button is shown in the navigation header when authenticated.
- **client**: Added OIDC authentication support for the CLI. When a server has `OIDC_PROTECT_FILES` or `OIDC_PROTECT_NOTES` enabled, the CLI automatically opens a browser for login before uploading or creating notes. Session tokens are stored per-server in `~/.config/skysend/tokens.json` and reused until they expire. New `auth` subcommands (`login`, `logout`, `status`) allow explicit session management.

### 🔒 Security

- **infra**: Added pnpm overrides for `@esbuild-kit/core-utils>esbuild` (`>=0.25.0`) and `vitepress>vite` (`~6.4.2`) to address GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 (esbuild dev server CORS bypass) and GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9 (Vite path traversal in optimized deps `.map` handling).
- **infra**: Updated all dependencies to latest versions - `vite` 8.0.13, `tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/vite` 4.3.0, `better-sqlite3` 12.10.0, `@aws-sdk/*` 3.1046.0, `i18next` 26.1.0, `lucide-react` 1.16.0, `tailwind-merge` 3.6.0, `vitest` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.6, `tsx` 4.22.0, and others.

### 🎨 Improvements

- **web**: The password input placeholder no longer says "(optional)" when `FORCE_FILE_PASSWORD` or `FORCE_NOTE_PASSWORD` is enabled - it now correctly says "(required)".
- **web**: The navigation header title now truncates with an ellipsis when a custom title is very long, preventing layout overflow on all screen sizes.
- **web**: Added a fade gradient at the bottom of the language switcher dropdown to indicate that the list is scrollable. The gradient disappears automatically when scrolled to the bottom.
- **web**: Added a hamburger menu for mobile screens. All navigation links, the language switcher, theme toggle, and OIDC login/logout are now accessible in a collapsible dropdown on small viewports.
- **web**: The language selector dropdown now has a fixed max height with a scrollable list (using shadcn ScrollArea) and a search input at the top, so all languages are accessible on small screens without getting cut off.
- **web**: The logout button tooltip in the navigation header now uses the shadcn Tooltip component instead of a native browser `title` attribute.

### 🧪 Tests

- **server**: Added unit tests for the OIDC auth layer, all four provider adapters, the guard middleware, and auth routes, plus expanded coverage across multiple server modules - overall line coverage improved from 84.44% to 90%.
- **client**: Added unit tests for the OIDC login flow and progress/password prompt utilities, bringing both modules to near-100% coverage.
- **web**: Added unit tests for the auth hook, session API, and all remaining hooks that previously had 0% coverage.
- **server**: Increased patch coverage for OIDC-related modules - added tests for `verifySessionJwt`/`verifyPkceJwt` returning null on malformed payloads, the `String(err)` branch in the discovery warm-up handler, and empty-claims fallback paths in all four provider adapters, bringing `auth/session.ts`, `routes/auth.ts`, and all `auth/adapters/*.ts` to 100% branch coverage.
- **client**: Added tests for the `getFreePort` error path and the `performOidcLogin` catch block, bringing `lib/oidc.ts` to 100% line coverage.

### 📝 Documentation

- **docs**: Added OIDC Authentication page to the Developer Guide API Reference, covering the full PKCE login flow, auth/callback/logout/session endpoints, the OIDC guard middleware, protected vs. always-public endpoints, provider adapters, session JWT format, and the CLI device-browser login flow.
- **docs**: Added OIDC/SSO to the features list on the landing page.
- **docs**: Extended the API Overview with the `/auth/*` endpoint table and a link to the new OIDC page.
- **docs**: Added `auth login`, `auth logout`, and `auth status` to the client CLI command reference, including the OIDC login flow explanation and token storage details.

## v2.7.1 - Two New Languages & Markdown Rendering Fixes
*Released: May 13, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **web**: Added Japanese (ja) translation. Thanks @canaria-computer ([#41](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/41))
- **web**: Added Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation. Thanks @magisph ([#40](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/40))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **web**: Fixed Markdown preview and note view not rendering headings, blockquotes, lists, and other block-level elements. The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin was installed but not loaded via `@plugin` in `index.css`, so `prose` styles had no effect. ([#42](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/42))

### 🔄 Changed

- **web**: Markdown prose elements (list bullets, counters, links, blockquote borders, table borders, and horizontal rules) now follow the project's primary color, including the `CUSTOM_COLOR` branding setting.

## v2.7.0 - Native OS Share Button, Security Patches, and Dependency Updates
*Released: May 8, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **web**: Added a native OS Share button to the upload success screen. Uses the Web Share API (`navigator.share()`) and is only shown on devices that support it (iOS Safari, Android Chrome). The Copy button remains unchanged as fallback.

### 🔒 Security

- **server**: Updated `hono` from `4.12.15` to `4.12.18` to patch two moderate vulnerabilities - `bodyLimit()` bypass for chunked requests (GHSA-9vqf-7f2p-gf9v) and unvalidated JSX tag names allowing HTML injection (GHSA-69xw-7hcm-h432).

### 🎨 Improvements

- **infra**: Updated all dependencies to their latest compatible versions (`react` 19.2.6, `zod` 4.4.3, `react-router-dom` 7.15.0, `vite` 8.0.11, `@aws-sdk/*` 3.1045.0, `eslint` 10.3.0, `dompurify` 3.4.2, and others).

## v2.6.0 - New Customization Options, Added Chinese Language and Bug Fixes
*Released: May 6, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **web**: Added Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) translation. Thanks @Liyouran-center ([#36](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/36))
- **server**: Added `DEFAULT_THEME` env var to set the default UI theme (`dark`, `light`, or `system`) for users who have not stored a preference. The user's own choice always takes precedence. ([#35](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/35))
- **server**: Added `DEFAULT_TAB` env var to set the default upload tab (`file`, `text`, `password`, `code`, or `sshkey`). Falls back to the first enabled tab if the configured tab is unavailable. ([#35](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/35))
- **server**: Added `FORCE_FILE_PASSWORD` env var - when set to `true`, all file uploads must be password-protected. Enforced on both the server (HTTP 400) and in the UI. ([#35](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/35))
- **server**: Added `FORCE_NOTE_PASSWORD` env var - when set to `true`, all note uploads (text, password, code, SSH key) must be password-protected. Enforced on both the server (HTTP 400) and in the UI. ([#35](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/35))
- **client**: `FORCE_FILE_PASSWORD` and `FORCE_NOTE_PASSWORD` are now respected by the CLI client. When enforced, the CLI automatically prompts for a password if `-p` was not provided. The interactive TUI skips the "Password protect?" question and goes directly to the password input prompt. ([#35](https://github.com/skyfay/SkySend/pull/35))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **docker**: Fixed health check failing when a custom `PORT` is set - the `HEALTHCHECK` command hardcoded port 3000 instead of reading the `PORT` environment variable. ([#34](https://github.com/Skyfay/SkySend/issues/34))

### 🔄 Changed

- **client**: WebSocket upload transport is globally disabled. Large file transfers via WebSocket over HTTPS connections fail mid-transfer due to an unresolved issue. HTTP chunked upload is now always used. The per-server toggle has been removed from the settings until the root cause is fixed.

## v2.5.7 - Docker Entrypoint Custom Data/Uploads Directory Fix
*Released: May 3, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **docker**: Fixed `EACCES: permission denied` on startup when `DATA_DIR` or `UPLOADS_DIR` are set to a custom path - the entrypoint previously hardcoded `/data` and `/uploads` for `mkdir` and `chown`, so custom paths were never created or made writable. The entrypoint now uses the actual `DATA_DIR` and `UPLOADS_DIR` environment variables.

## v2.5.6 - Docker Entrypoint PGID Fix
*Released: May 3, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **docker**: Fixed container startup failing with `addgroup: group 'skysend' in use` when `PGID` is set to a value other than the default `1001` - `busybox`'s `delgroup` cannot remove a group that still has members, so the subsequent `addgroup` always failed. The entrypoint now uses `sed` to update the GID in-place in `/etc/group` and `/etc/passwd`, matching the existing approach used for `PUID`.

## v2.5.5 - CSP Fix for Password-Protected Uploads, Downloads and Notes
*Released: May 2, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **server**: Fixed password-protected file and note uploads/downloads failing with `WebAssembly.compile() blocked by CSP` in browsers behind reverse proxies that forward CSP headers - added `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to `script-src` to allow Argon2id (hash-wasm) to compile its inline WASM binary.

## v2.5.4 - Content Security Policy Update for Custom Logo Support
*Released: May 1, 2026*

### 🔄 Changed

- **server**: Content Security Policy now dynamically allows the origin of `CUSTOM_LOGO` in `img-src` when an external HTTP(S) logo URL is configured, while keeping the default image policy strict.

- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64


## v2.5.3 - WebSocket Upload Keepalive
*Released: April 25, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **server**: Fixed WebSocket uploads hanging at 100% on remote servers behind a reverse proxy - the server now sends a keepalive message every 5 seconds during the finalization phase so Caddy/Nginx/Traefik do not close the connection as idle while the server is still flushing data to storage and writing to the DB.

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **infra**: Added branche ignore rule to stop branch-specific workflows (e.g. `release.yml`) from running on the `main` branch - these workflows are only meant to run on feature branches and tags, not on `main` where they cause noise and duplicate runs alongside the generic `validate.yml`.

### 🐳 Docker

- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64


## v2.5.2 - Client Improvements & Bug fixes
*Released: April 25, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **client**: Fixed `resolveServer()` ignoring `defaultServer` and using the legacy top-level `server` field instead - if both fields exist in `config.json` (e.g. after migrating to multi-server), the TUI and all commands now correctly prefer `defaultServer`.
- **client**: Fixed WebSocket uploads hanging at 100% on remote servers - the progress bar reached 100% as soon as data was queued in Node.js's send buffer, not when it arrived at the server, causing the fixed 5-minute finalize timeout to expire for large files on slow connections. The send buffer is now drained to zero before sending "finalize", the timeout is dynamic (5 min + 2 s/MB), and the TUI/CLI show "Finalizing..." while waiting for the server confirmation.

### 🎨 Improvements

- **client**: TUI and non-interactive CLI now display the average upload speed on the summary screen after a successful upload, matching the existing web behavior.

### 📝 Documentation

- **docs**: Updated the benchmarks page with more specific details on the environment, new results and client tests.

## v2.5.1 - Bug fixes, dependency updates, and Dockerfile improvements
*Released: April 25, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **client**: Fixed `skysend update` failing on Windows with "Permission denied" even as Administrator. Windows locks running `.exe` files, so `fs.renameSync` always threw `EPERM`. The fix spawns a detached, hidden `cmd.exe` batch script that waits 2 seconds (until the current process exits) then moves the downloaded binary into place with `move /y`.
- **client**: Fixed `install.ps1` hanging silently during download. PowerShell's default `$ProgressPreference = 'Continue'` makes `Invoke-WebRequest` up to 100x slower and shows no feedback in many terminal environments. The script now sets `$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'` and prints `Downloading <file>... done (X.X MB)` and `Verifying checksum... ok` step messages instead.
- **client**: Fixed `install.sh` showing no output during binary download. `curl -fsSL` and `wget -q` were fully silent. The binary download now uses `curl --progress-bar` (shows a `#####` bar on stderr) and `wget` without `-q`, so users see download progress.
- **server**: Fixed S3 uploads failing with Cloudflare R2 and other S3-compatible providers with the error `[EntityReplacer] Invalid character '#' in entity name: "#xD"`. The root cause was `fast-xml-parser@5.7.1` introducing a regression where numeric character references (e.g. `&#xD;`) in XML responses could no longer be parsed. Updated `fast-xml-parser` override to `>=5.7.2` which restores correct behavior.
- **server**: Set `requestChecksumCalculation` and `responseChecksumValidation` to `WHEN_REQUIRED` on the S3 client. AWS SDK v3 >=3.679 defaults to `WHEN_SUPPORTED`, causing proactive CRC checksum headers that can trigger provider-specific XML parsing issues.

### 🔒 Security

- **infra**: Added `pnpm.overrides` for `postcss` (`>=8.5.10`) to patch a moderate XSS vulnerability (GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93) in transitive dependencies via `autoprefixer`

### 🎨 Improvements

- **server**: Updated `@hono/node-server` from v1 to v2 - same public API, up to 2.3x faster body parsing via optimized direct Node.js `IncomingMessage` reads, URL construction fast-path, and `buildOutgoingHttpHeaders` optimization
- **infra**: Updated patch and minor dependencies across all workspace packages - `hono`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/lib-storage`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`, `better-sqlite3`, `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `react-router-dom`, `i18next`, `react-i18next`, `lucide-react`, `autoprefixer`, `vite`, `vue`, `wrangler`, `@cloudflare/workers-types`, `prettier`, `typescript`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `globals`, `typescript-eslint`
- **infra**: Updated `eslint` and `@eslint/js` from v9 to v10, and `commander` from v13 to v14 - no API changes required, fixed two new `eslint:recommended` rules (`no-useless-assignment` in upload chunking code, `preserve-caught-error` in upload worker)
- **web**: Removed deprecated `@types/dompurify` - DOMPurify v3+ ships its own TypeScript declarations
- **infra**: Added `COPY apps/client/package.json`, `COPY apps/client/stubs/`, and `COPY workers/instances/package.json` to the Dockerfile build stage so `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` can resolve all workspace packages (including the `file:` stub dependency in `@skysend/client`) before `COPY . .`

### 🗑️ Removed

- **server**: Removed `S3_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable. S3 downloads now exclusively use presigned URLs, which enforce expiry and download limits server-side and expire automatically. Public bucket URLs allowed clients to bypass these controls by reusing a captured URL.

### 📝 Documentation

- **docs**: Removed PBKDF2-SHA256 fallback references from `password-protection.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/index.md` - password protection now exclusively documents Argon2id

## v2.5.0 - Security Audit Fixes, Test Coverage Improvements, and Docker Metadata Labels
*Released: April 23, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **server**: Added per-IP per-resource password attempt lockout - after 10 failed attempts the IP is locked out for 15 minutes with a `Retry-After` header, IPs stored as ephemeral HMAC-SHA256 hashes, configurable via `PASSWORD_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and `PASSWORD_LOCKOUT_MS`

### 🔒 Security

- **server**: Updated `hono` from `4.12.12` to `4.12.14` to fix HTML injection via improperly handled JSX attribute names in SSR (GHSA-458j-xx4x-4375)
- **infra**: Added `pnpm.overrides` for `esbuild` (`>=0.25.0`), `vite` (`>=6.4.2`), and `fast-xml-parser` (`>=5.7.0`) to patch transitive vulnerabilities in dev/docs dependencies (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99, GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9, GHSA-gh4j-gqv2-49f6)
- **crypto**: Tightened Argon2id-to-PBKDF2 fallback logic - the fallback now only triggers on WASM availability errors (`CompileError`, `LinkError`, or matching message) and propagates all other crypto errors instead of silently swallowing them
- **crypto**: Increased Argon2id parameters from 19 MiB / 2 iterations to 64 MiB / 3 iterations, matching OWASP's strong recommendation and significantly raising GPU brute-force cost for new password-protected uploads
- **crypto**: Increased HKDF salt length from 16 to 32 bytes for new uploads, matching the RFC 5869 recommendation to use a salt equal to the hash output length - legacy 16-byte salts from existing uploads are still accepted
- **crypto**: Added stream truncation detection to `createDecryptStream` - callers can pass `expectedPlaintextSize` (from authenticated metadata) to detect a malicious server delivering fewer records than were encrypted
- **server**: Added `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` HTTP header to prevent URL fragments from leaking via `Referer` header in misconfigured or future environments
- **web**: Added `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">` to `index.html` as defense-in-depth for the referrer policy
- **web**: URL fragment (encryption key) is now removed from the browser address bar via `history.replaceState` once decryption begins, preventing key leakage through browser history
- **web**: Note uploads now use Argon2id for password key derivation - previously PBKDF2 was always used for notes due to a missing argument
- **crypto**: Removed Argon2id-to-PBKDF2 upload fallback entirely - if Argon2id WASM fails during an upload, an error is thrown instead of silently downgrading to PBKDF2 ("fail secure"), PBKDF2 decryption for existing uploads is unaffected
- **web**: Added DOMPurify sanitization of highlight.js output before `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in code notes - defense-in-depth against any future upstream hljs vulnerability
- **web**: Added `rehype-sanitize` plugin to ReactMarkdown rendering in notes - prevents XSS from future react-markdown upstream changes that could enable raw HTML
- **web**: URL fragment (encryption key) is now removed from the browser address bar via `history.replaceState` in `NoteView` immediately at page mount - previously only the Download page had this protection
- **server**: Fixed IP extraction when `TRUST_PROXY=true` - previously the leftmost (client-controlled) value from `X-Forwarded-For` was used, allowing clients to spoof their IP and bypass rate limiting and upload quotas, now uses the rightmost (proxy-appended) value
- **server**: Fixed S3 download with `S3_PUBLIC_URL` configured - previously a permanent public URL was returned, remaining valid indefinitely after DB record deletion and bypassing expiry/download-limit enforcement, now always uses presigned URLs with a TTL
- **web**: Replaced deprecated `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag with the standard `mobile-web-app-capable` equivalent - eliminates browser console warning, the PWA manifest `display: standalone` already handles standalone mode on modern browsers

### 🎨 Improvements

- **web**: Password prompt now shows a translated "too many attempts" error when the server returns 429 instead of switching away from the password screen

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **infra**: Added OCI standard labels to Docker images via `docker/metadata-action@v5` - sets `title`, `description`, `url`, `source`, `version`, `revision`, `created`, `vendor`, and `licenses` for better registry compatibility and Renovate/Dependabot integration

### 🧪 Tests

- **crypto**: Expanded to 129 tests with 100% coverage - added security-property tests for HKDF domain separation, ECE reorder/truncation attacks, Argon2id error propagation, PBKDF2 known-answer verification, and legacy salt backward compatibility.
- **server**: Added 24 integration tests for the chunked upload flow (`/init`, `/chunk`, `/finalize`), password-attempt lockout (429 + `Retry-After`), and invalid input handling across `meta.ts`, `password.ts`, and `note.ts` routes.
- **server**: Added 5 tests for `startCleanupJob` (interval, stop function, logging, error recovery) - bringing `cleanup.ts` to 100%.
- **server**: Brought `upload-validation.ts` and `quota.ts` to 100% - covers all `check()`, `getStatus()`, 413 middleware, DB key restoration, and interval behavior (rotation, expiry cleanup).
- **infra**: Added `vitest.config.ts` for `server` and `client`, updated `vite.config.ts` for `web` - all with scoped `coverage.include` and explicit excludes for untestable files (browser workers, WASM, S3 backend, app entrypoints).

## v2.4.3 - Codecov, Unit Test Improvements & Web Improvements
*Released: April 21, 2026*

### ✨ Features
- **client**: TUI "Manage servers" now supports adding, deleting, and setting a server as default via a server action sub-menu

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **web**: Fixed note view incorrectly showing "permanently deleted" warning for unlimited-view notes (`maxViews === 0`)

### 🧪 Tests
- **infra**: Added `@vitest/coverage-v8` and `test:coverage` scripts to `server`, `web`, `crypto`, and `client` packages for coverage report generation in LCOV format
- **web**: Added 57 unit tests across `lib/utils`, `lib/password-generator`, and `lib/upload-store` - covering formatting functions, `isSafari` detection, `generatePassword`/`calculateEntropy`, and full CRUD/sorting for IndexedDB upload and note storage (using an in-memory `idb-keyval` mock)
- **client**: Added 93 unit tests across `lib/progress`, `lib/url`, `lib/password-generator`, `lib/config`, and `lib/history` - covering all formatting/parsing utilities, full `parseShareUrl`/`buildShareUrl` logic including edge cases, password generation, config file lifecycle with filesystem isolation via `tmpdir`, and history CRUD with expiry cleanup

### 🔧 CI/CD
- **infra**: Updated `validate.yml` test job to run with coverage and upload reports to Codecov via `codecov/codecov-action@v5`
- **infra**: Added `codecov.yml` with project and patch coverage status checks
- **crypto**: Added 14 new unit tests covering previously untested security-critical paths: `validateMetadata` error branches (invalid JSON, null payload, unknown type, malformed archive entries, negative sizes, empty names, missing MIME type), `deriveKeyFromPasswordArgon2` input validation, ECE decrypt stream "record too short" path, and exact error message matching for the nonce-missing guard. Coverage: 94% → 99.29% statements, 88% → 97.82% branches. Added `vitest.config.ts` to exclude the re-export barrel `src/index.ts` from coverage.

## v2.4.2 - WebSocket Upload Toggle and CLI History Command
*Released: April 20, 2026*

### ✨ Features
- **client**: Added WebSocket transport toggle - disable WebSocket uploads via `--no-ws` CLI flag, TUI Settings menu, or `\"websocket\": false` in config file- **client**: Added `skysend ls` command to list upload and note history with age, expiry, and size - supports `--server`, `--all`, and `--json` flags

### 🎨 Improvements
- **client**: Connection error screen now offers recovery options - press `s` to select another server or `r` to retry instead of requiring Ctrl+C exit
- **client**: Connection errors now show a user-friendly message (`Server <url> is not reachable`) instead of the raw `fetch failed` error
- **client**: `skysend config` now shows all registered servers with their per-server WebSocket status

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: Added WebSocket transport configuration section to CLI client documentation

*Released: April 20, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **client**: Fixed `Cannot find package 'react-devtools-core'` runtime error when running compiled CLI binaries - replaced `--external` flag with a bundled no-op stub so Ink's optional devtools import resolves inside the binary

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: Shortened CLI install URLs from raw GitHub links to `skysend.app/install.sh` and `skysend.app/install.ps1` redirects across README, docs, and install scripts

## v2.4.0 - CLI Client, PWA Support and ZIP creating improvements
*Released: April 19, 2026*

### ✨ Features
- **web**: Added PWA (Progressive Web App) support - SkySend can now be installed as an app on desktop (Chrome, Edge), Android, and iOS via "Add to Home Screen"
- **client**: Added `@skysend/client` CLI binary for uploading and downloading files with end-to-end encryption from the terminal - supports single/multi-file uploads, encrypted notes, password protection, WebSocket and HTTP chunked transports, and cross-platform Bun-compiled binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **web**: Added Argon2id password KDF support to the web frontend and upload worker using hash-wasm, enabling cross-compatibility with CLI password-protected uploads

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **web**: Fixed WebSocket upload failing through Vite dev proxy by enabling `ws: true` on the API proxy config

### 🎨 Improvements
- **web**: Multi-file uploads now show a determinate progress bar (0-100%) during the packing phase instead of an indeterminate spinner
- **web**: Multi-file ZIP creation moved from main thread into the upload worker, reducing peak memory usage by ~50% for large uploads
- **web**: Average upload speed is now displayed on the share link page after upload completes

### 🔄 Changed
- **cli**: Renamed admin CLI binary from `skysend` to `skysend-cli` to avoid conflict with the new client binary (consistent with Docker and documentation)

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: Cleaned up docker compose example in the user guide - removed redundant comments and simplified environment variable list with a link to the full reference
- **docs**: Added CLI client documentation - overview, installation guide (Linux/macOS/Windows), detailed command reference for all 7 commands (`upload`, `download`, `note`, `note:view`, `delete`, `config`, `update`)
- **docs**: Updated README, docs homepage, getting started, installation, first steps, architecture, setup, and roadmap pages with CLI client information

### 🔧 CI/CD
- **infra**: Added CLI binary build pipeline to release workflow - compiles Bun binaries for 5 targets (linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64, windows-x64) with SHA-256 checksums and attaches them to GitHub Releases
- **infra**: Added install scripts for Linux/macOS (`install.sh`) and Windows (`install.ps1`) with automatic platform detection and checksum verification

## v2.3.0 - WebSocket Upload Transport for Improved Performance in Proxied Environments
*Released: April 17, 2026*

### ✨ Features
- **server**: Added a WebSocket upload transport at `/api/upload/ws` that streams the encrypted payload over a single persistent connection, eliminating the HTTP/2 multiplexing bottleneck that reverse proxies (Traefik, Nginx) impose on parallel chunk uploads
- **server**: Added `FILE_UPLOAD_WS` environment variable (default: `true`) to enable or disable the WebSocket upload transport
- **server**: Added `FILE_UPLOAD_WS_MAX_BUFFER` environment variable (default: `16MB`) to cap the per-session server receive buffer for WebSocket uploads
- **web**: Upload worker now uses the WebSocket transport as the primary upload path and automatically falls back to the existing HTTP chunked upload when the handshake fails, is blocked, or times out (10 s)

### 🔒 Security
- **server**: Added `Origin` header validation on WebSocket upgrade requests to prevent cross-site WebSocket hijacking (defence-in-depth, not exploitable due to token requirements)

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: Added `FILE_UPLOAD_WS` and `FILE_UPLOAD_WS_MAX_BUFFER` to the user-guide environment variables page and the developer-guide environment reference
- **docs**: Documented the WebSocket upload protocol in the upload API reference, including message shapes, close codes, and client fallback triggers
- **docs**: Added Nginx and Traefik configuration snippets for the WebSocket upload transport in the reverse-proxy guide
- **docs**: Updated developer-guide architecture to document both WebSocket (primary) and HTTP chunked (fallback) upload transports with flow diagrams

## v2.2.4 - Max Concurrent Chunk Uploads and Speed Limit Configuration
*Released: April 15, 2026*

### ✨ Features
- **server**: Added `FILE_UPLOAD_CONCURRENT_CHUNKS` environment variable (default: `3`) to control the number of parallel chunk uploads per session - increase to improve upload speed in Chromium browsers through HTTP/2 proxies
- **server**: Added `FILE_UPLOAD_SPEED_LIMIT` environment variable (default: `0` = unlimited) to cap upload throughput per session - supports human-readable values like `100MB` (bytes per second)
- **web**: Client now reads the configured concurrent chunk count from the server and adjusts parallel uploads accordingly

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: Added `FILE_UPLOAD_CONCURRENT_CHUNKS` and `FILE_UPLOAD_SPEED_LIMIT` to user-guide environment variables page with new "Upload Performance" section
- **docs**: Added `FILE_UPLOAD_CONCURRENT_CHUNKS` and `FILE_UPLOAD_SPEED_LIMIT` to developer-guide environment reference

## v2.2.3 - Critical Bug Fixes for Chunked Uploads in HTTP/2 Proxied Environments
*Released: April 15, 2026*

- **server**: Fixed rate limiter path matching - the regex anchor (`^`) prevented chunk requests from being recognized through the `/api` sub-router, causing 429 errors despite the exemption
- **server**: Fixed HTTP/2 flow-control deadlock that caused uploads to stall at 0-1% in Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge through reverse proxies - the server now reads each chunk body immediately instead of deferring reads in a promise chain, preventing proxy flow-control backpressure from blocking the connection

### 🐳 Docker

- **Image**: `skyfay/skysend:v2.2.3`
- **Also tagged as**: `latest`, `v2`
- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64


## v2.2.2 - Bug Fixes for Chunked Uploads in Brave and Edge
*Released: April 15, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **server**: Chunk upload requests (`/upload/:id/chunk`) are now exempt from the global rate limiter - previously, uploading a large file would exceed the 60 requests/minute limit and cause 429 errors, breaking uploads entirely in production
- **web**: Chunk upload body changed from `Blob` to `ArrayBuffer` - fixes uploads permanently stalling at 0% in Brave and Edge, where the browser opened HTTP/2 streams but never sent DATA frames for Blob bodies from Web Workers

### 🐳 Docker

- **Image**: `skyfay/skysend:v2.2.2`
- **Also tagged as**: `latest`, `v2`
- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64


## v2.2.1 - Parallel Chunk Uploads and Performance Improvements
*Released: April 15, 2026*

### 🎨 Improvements
- **web**: Upload chunks are now sent in parallel (up to 3 concurrent, 10 MB each) instead of sequentially (50 MB each), dramatically improving upload speed in Chrome, Brave, and Edge through reverse proxies like Traefik
- **server**: Chunk upload endpoint accepts an `index` query parameter and reassembles chunks in-order on the server, ensuring data integrity with parallel client uploads
- **server**: In-order chunks are now streamed directly to storage without buffering, eliminating unnecessary memory copies on the hot path
- **server**: Optimized S3 multipart upload buffering to avoid full-buffer reallocation on every chunk append
- **server**: S3 part uploads now run as a concurrent pool with smooth backpressure - waits for one upload slot to free up instead of draining everything, giving consistent throughput instead of burst-stop cycles

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: Updated architecture diagram with chunked upload flow (init, parallel chunks with index, finalize)
- **docs**: Added chunked upload API documentation (init, chunk, finalize endpoints) to developer guide
- **docs**: Added chunked upload endpoints to API overview table

## v2.2.0 - S3 Storage Backend
*Released: April 15, 2026*

### ✨ Features
- **server**: Added S3-compatible storage backend as alternative to local filesystem storage
- **server**: Added `STORAGE_BACKEND` environment variable to switch between `filesystem` (default) and `s3` storage
- **server**: Added S3 configuration via environment variables (`S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`, `S3_PRESIGNED_EXPIRY`, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`)
- **server**: Uploads in S3 mode stream directly to S3 via multipart upload without disk buffering on the server
- **server**: Added `S3_PUBLIC_URL` for direct download URLs via R2 custom domains or public buckets - avoids presigned URL complexity and CORS issues
- **server**: Falls back to presigned URLs when `S3_PUBLIC_URL` is not set (for private buckets)
- **web**: Client download logic transparently handles both direct file streams (filesystem), presigned URL redirects (S3 private), and public URL redirects (S3 public)
- **server**: Supports all S3-compatible providers (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Hetzner Object Storage, MinIO, Wasabi, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces, and more) via custom endpoint configuration
- **server**: Logs storage mode on startup (filesystem path or S3 endpoint with public/presigned mode)
- **server**: S3 connectivity test on startup - verifies bucket access, write, and delete permissions before accepting requests
- **server**: Added `S3_PART_SIZE` and `S3_CONCURRENCY` environment variables for tuning S3 upload throughput
- **web**: Download progress bar now shows real-time download speed (e.g. `42.5 MB/s`) alongside the percentage, matching the upload speed display

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **docker**: Fixed Docker healthcheck showing `unhealthy` despite a running server - replaced `wget` (not available in Alpine) with Node.js `fetch` and increased start period to 30s
- **web**: Upload progress bar now reflects actual end-to-end upload progress instead of encryption speed - progress updates after each chunk is fully uploaded (including server-to-S3 forwarding)

### 🔒 Security
- **server**: CSP `connect-src` header is dynamically extended to allow client fetches to the configured S3 endpoint

### 🎨 Improvements
- **server**: Introduced `StorageBackend` interface with adapter pattern for pluggable storage implementations
- **server**: Optimized S3 multipart upload performance - configurable part size (default 25MB) and parallel part uploads (default 4 concurrent) to reduce round-trip overhead

### 📝 Documentation
- **docs**: Added S3 storage backend section to environment variables reference with configuration table, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`, and provider examples (R2, MinIO)
- **docs**: Added S3 variable definitions to developer environment reference (`STORAGE_BACKEND`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`, `S3_PRESIGNED_EXPIRY`, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`, `S3_PART_SIZE`, `S3_CONCURRENCY`)
- **docs**: Updated architecture diagram and data storage section to reflect S3 backend and download flow
- **docs**: Added S3 CORS configuration guide with examples for Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, and MinIO
- **docs**: Added S3 Docker Compose example with `S3_PUBLIC_URL` to self-hosting guide
- **docs**: Updated data backups guide with S3 storage note
- **docs**: Added S3 storage mention to README and docs homepage feature cards

- **docs**: Added service filter (All / Files / Notes) to instances page based on each instance's `enabledServices` configuration
- **docs**: Added skeleton loading animation while instance data is being fetched
- **docs**: Instance list is now maintained via `docs/public/instances.json` - users can add instances via pull request
- **docs**: Instance cards show separate Files and Notes stats sections, each only visible when the service is enabled
- **docs**: Instance cards show "Official" or "Community" badge, with official instances (skysend.app) always sorted first
- **web**: Added language switcher dropdown in the navbar with country flag icons via `flag-icons` library
