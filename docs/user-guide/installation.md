Supports: Intel/AMD servers, Raspberry Pi 4+, Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), AWS Graviton
:::

## Docker Installation

::: code-group

```yaml [Docker Compose]
services:
  skysend:
    image: skyfay/skysend:latest
    container_name: skysend
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./uploads:/uploads
    environment:
      - BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
      # All environment variables: https://docs.skysend.app/user-guide/configuration/environment-variables
      # There are a lot of customization options available, so make sure to check the documentation for more details.
```

```bash [Docker Run]
docker run -d \
  --name skysend \
  --restart always \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -e UPLOADS_DIR=/uploads \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  -v "$(pwd)/uploads:/uploads" \
  skyfay/skysend:latest
```

:::

### Start & Access

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

SkySend is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

All environment variables are optional. SkySend works out of the box with sensible defaults.

→ See the full **[Environment Variables](/user-guide/configuration/environment-variables)** reference for all options, default values and descriptions.

## Volume Mounts

| Mount Point | Required | Purpose |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `/data` | ✅ | Database and persistent data. Also holds `/data/branding` for your own logo. |
| `/uploads` | ✅ | Encrypted file storage. |

::: warning Data Persistence
Always mount both `/data` and `/uploads` to host directories. Without volumes, all uploads and database state are lost when the container is recreated.
:::

## Health Check

SkySend includes a built-in Docker health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "2.11.3",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The health check runs every 30 seconds. Docker marks the container as `unhealthy` if 3 consecutive checks fail.

## CLI Client

The SkySend CLI client lets you upload and download files from the terminal with the same end-to-end encryption as the web interface. It is a standalone binary with no runtime dependencies.

### Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skysend.app/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://skysend.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
skysend --version
skysend --help
```

See the full [CLI Client documentation](/user-guide/client-cli/) for setup, configuration, and all available commands.
